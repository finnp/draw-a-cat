## Hi, there!

Hi, this is a tutorial on how to draw a cat using JavaScript and canvas.

On the left you should see a cat with a pop-tart body. You might recognize this
kind of cat [from the internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH2-TGUlwu4).

Below is all the Javascript code for drawing this cat. Don't worry if you don't
understand it. That's what this tutorial is about: To teach you how to do this
yourself.

To begin with, have a look at the first 3 lines of this program:
```js
var catHeight = 150
var catX = 0
var catY = 0
```

Those are so called variables (therefore the `var`) that you can assign value to.

Try to change some of this values and see what happens. Don't worry if you break
something (e.g. the cat is disappearing).

## Goal

Set `catX` and `catY` to 100, to put the cat out of the corner.
Then click verify to pass this challenge.
