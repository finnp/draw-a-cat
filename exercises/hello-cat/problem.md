## Hi, there!

Hi, this is a tutorial on how to draw a cat using JavaScript and HTML canvas.

I don't assume that you already know any JavaScript or even programming. But if
you do, feel free to follow along as well.

Let's get to it: On the left you should see a cat with a pop-tart body. You might 
recognize this kind of cat [from the internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH2-TGUlwu4).

Below is everything that makes this cat look like that. It's the JavaScript code 
for drawing this cat. Don't worry if you don't understand it. That's what this
tutorial is about: To teach you how to do this yourself.

To begin with, have a look at the first 3 lines of this program:
```js
var catHeight = 150
var catX = 0
var catY = 0
```

Those are so called variables (therefore the `var`) that you can assign a value to.
They are called variables because their values can change over time.

Try to change some of this values and see what happens. Don't worry if you break
something (e.g. the cat is disappearing). There is a reset button, that will bring
you back to the beginning.

## Instructions

Set `catX` and `catY` in the editor below to 100, to put the cat out of the corner.
Then click verify to pass this challenge.

## Optional

After you are done, you can play around with the code a bit. Try to break it on
purpose or see what happens if you change other values.
