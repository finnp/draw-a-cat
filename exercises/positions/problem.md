## Position

Your cat probably looked awesome. I also added that tail to my cat. Wouldn't it
be cool if there was a lazy way to change the cats position? In the last exercise
we would have to change each value of the body parts to change the position of the
cat.

But you might remember the first exercise. There it was much easier to change
the cats position. You just had to change two numbers, the x and y position.

Below I tried to do that for my pretty cat as well. Try playing around with the
`x` and `y` variables.

It doesn't work? D'oh, I forgot to do it for the `y` coordinate. Can you fix it?

## JavaScript: Simple Maths

Sometimes simple Maths can be useful in programming. JavaScript knows simple Maths like
 `*`, `+`, `/` and `-`. They can be used to calculate new values from Numbers.
 Like `1 + 10` will be `11`.

 You can also do Maths with variables. So if you specified `var x = 10` and then
 do `x + 5` it will be `15`.

 Below you can see that I use this to position the cat on the `x` axis.

## Instructions

Make sure it's possible to position the cat with the `y` value as well.
