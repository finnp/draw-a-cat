## Square cat

Now that we can create colored rectangles, we can already draw a lot. If you
think about the pixels on your screen, they are just a bunch of colored rectangles.
So we could basically draw everything now. (Don't worry though, there are cooler ways to draw,
that we'll learn later).

Let's use rectangles to draw a simple cat. It will look a bit squared, but cats
love boxes, so that makes sense doesn't it?

I've already drawn one. Do you like it? What?! You think it lacks a tail? Pff, maybe
you can do it better.

## JavaScript: Comments

Code is not only for computers, but mostly for humans who read and write it.
Sometimes you have secrets, that you don't want to share with JavaScript.
You can use two slashes for that: `//`. Using them means JavaScript will never
know about what is written right to those characters on that line.

This means
```js
ctx.fillRect(60,170,30,40)
```
 will draw a rectangle, but
```js
//ctx.fillRect(60,170,30,40)
```
not, because it is commented out.


## Instructions

Draw a cool cat with rectangles and different colors. You can use what I've done
so far or start from scratch. Use comments to remember which rectangles are for
which body parts.

When you are done, you should create a screen shot and [tweet it to me](https://twitter.com/finnpauls)
or share it with your friends.
